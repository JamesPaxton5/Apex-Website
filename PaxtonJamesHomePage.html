	<h2>My highest moments on Apex</h2>
	<p>When season 8 dropped <span class="boldtext italictext">I was skilled with Lifeline to be able to win fire fights and support my teammates for many battles royal wins.</span> Many players had set teammates that would give them an advantage because they had better communication. When a full team of 3 had master skills and communication it was hard to beat them. This moved more casual gamers into the public matches and the sweaty players (sweaty players means really skilled players) in rank. Due to this it made ranking up challenging but fun.</p>

	<h3>Session 13 Changed it All </h3> 
	<p>Season 13 update was <span class="boldtext">different</span> than others because the board members and senior staff have changed and so did their idea for Apex. One change that really stuck out the most to me was rank. They changed the point system around and how to get points. This may sound small to players that don’t play Apex, but this changes the full size of playing you were used to. Where you would land or rush, now you are avoiding. Also, some of the same bug as sound or Loba bracelet still haven’t been addressed.</p>

	<h4>What the Fans Want to See</h4>
	<p>To some up what fans would like to see change in Apex for the next update is balanced rank points and Pub matches. Because right now the standard player can gain any points or skills due to normal life. Where streamers and pro players play Apex fulltime. Another thing players would like to see is the sound be fixed. Again, this sounds like something simple, but it can be a game changer to a fire fight. The list can go on and on with small but important updates players and fans would like to see. We look forward to seeing this in upcoming updates.</p>
