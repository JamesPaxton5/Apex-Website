	<h1>Begining of Apex for me</h1>
	<p>I started my <span class="italictext">Apex journey</span> on season 7. My main was Lifeline because I was about to support the team better then I could kill enemies. Lifeline had a drone the popped up a bulletproof shield while it revived downed teammates. Players would use this shield to play aggressive defense. Players would be able to play rank which was hard but enjoyable to the balance of skilled enemies and points. There was no problem seeing casual players spending all Saturday night on Apex without feeling frustrated.</p>
